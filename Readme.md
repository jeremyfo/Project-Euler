# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

This repository is just a place to store my solutions to
the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

__Note:__ If you haven't solved the problems yourself, I would advise
you to at least try to solve them before looking at the solutions.

beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is
often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights
so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will
not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process
and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany
of discovery."_

## Solutions

All solutions were coded in Python. Since the point of this for me is to solve the problems and learn Python along the way the solutions are not necessarily optimized or efficient. Most solutions are brute-force solutions.
